# Fix: Naming and Structure Compliance for Phase 19.2

## 🔍 Overview

This PR addresses naming convention and structural compliance issues identified by the governance_observer_agent_v1 during a repository audit. All changes align with the standards defined in `rules.md`, `cline-rules.md`, and `cline_guide.md`.

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### Agent Directory Renames
- Renamed `agents/blueprint_optimizer_v1` → `agents/blueprint_optimizer_agent_v1`
- Renamed `agents/cycle_memory_v1` → `agents/cycle_memory_agent_v1`
- Renamed `agents/memory_steward_v1` → `agents/memory_steward_agent_v1`
- Renamed `agents/cycle_registry_v1` → `agents/cycle_registry_agent_v1`

### File Extension Standardization
- Converted `logs/execution_log_v2.txt` → `logs/execution_log_v2.json` (structured format)
- Migrated `scripts/supabase-connectivity-test.js` → `scripts/supabase_connectivity_test.mjs` (ES module)
- Migrated `scripts/supabase-connectivity-test.cjs` → `scripts/supabase_connectivity_test_simple.mjs` (ES module)

### Core File Standardization
- Removed duplicate file `agents/github_agent_v1/github_agent_v1_core.mjs` (retained `github_agent_core.mjs`)
- Removed duplicate file `agents/devops_agent_v1/devops_agent_v1_core.mjs` (retained `devops_agent_core.mjs`)
