# UI component dependencies
component_dependencies:
  tailwind_ui:
    - AuthCard
    - SidebarWithCollapsibleNav
    - SectionHeader
    - FormLayoutWithTabs
    - ActionListPanel
  custom:
    - TriggerTile
    - BlueprintScoreCard
    - ReviewerApprovalModal
    - SettingsFormLayout

# Implementation constraints and notes
implementation_notes:
  - Always refactor Tailwind UI components to match design tokens
  - Avoid using Tailwind UI dialogs/popovers (replace with Radix/ShadCN)
  - Use ShadCN for components requiring YAML awareness or interactivity
  - Ensure responsive layout adapts to tablet and mobile views
  - View states should be preserved across devices using role-aware local storage
