## 🌟 Vision Statement

Forgeborn is a next-generation AI-native software factory designed to autonomously plan, build, validate, and deploy software using agents, blueprints, skills, and runtime orchestration. Its mission is to drastically compress the time from idea to production by creating a composable, self-optimizing ecosystem capable of building and improving itself through intelligent feedback loops.

---

## 🚀 Strategic Objectives

- **Agent-Native Development**: Empower specialized agents to handle planning, code generation, CI/CD, infrastructure, and optimization cycles.
- **Autonomous Execution**: Support cognition loops—planning, evaluation, reflection—to evolve blueprints and skills with minimal human input.
- **Multi-LLM Integration**: Dynamically route tasks to optimal LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) based on performance.
- **Memory-Driven Evolution**: Use memory embeddings, execution traces, and logs to inform decision-making and plan validation.
- **Blueprint-Centric Factory**: Treat blueprints as the atomic unit of intent, processed and transformed into real software via agents.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Allow seamless integration with external platforms (Supabase, GitHub, Terraform, LangChain, llmanager).

## 🧠 Key System Components

### 1. **Agents**
- `meta_orchestrator_v1/v2`: Coordinates cognition cycles and agent routing.
- `planning_agent_v1`: Generates roadmap context and planning outputs.
- `reflection_agent_v1`: Summarizes past execution for self-optimization.
- `builder_agent_v1`: Converts specs into production-ready code.
- `supabase_agent_v1`, `devops_agent_v2`, `github_agent_v1`: Manage external integration.
- `graph_mapper_agent_v1`, `vector_agent_v1`: Power structural and semantic memory.

### 2. **Skills**
- Each `.mjs` file in agent `skills/` acts as a runtime executable unit.
- Executed by `skill_loader_agent_v1` at runtime for flexibility.
- New skills can be hotloaded and evaluated via blueprints.

### 3. **Blueprints**
- Describe what to build in YAML format.
- Trigger agent execution plans and track improvement across RCs.
- Serve as the canonical source of software factory intent.

### 4. **Memory & Logs**
- Persist execution traces, reflection summaries, and embedding chunks to Supabase.
- Leverage `forgeborn.llm_logs` and blueprint memory timelines for version-aware decisions.

### 5. **CLI**
- The `factory` CLI scaffolds blueprints and triggers agent plans.
- Acts as a human interface for prompting and monitoring the factory system.

## 🔭 Future Directions

### 🧩 Integration Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate LangChain `llmanager` features for skill/task graph visualization.
- [ ] Add agent containers for persistent state and task delegation.
- [ ] Expand multi-model LLM intelligence scoring and feedback loop.
- [ ] Implement blueprint skill evolution scorecard and automatic repair.

### 🛡️ Security & Governance
- [ ] Integrate `secrets_agent_v1` to enforce token/credential safety.
- [ ] Harden logging pipeline with signed commits and audit trails.

### 🧪 Testing & Evaluation
- [ ] Add blueprint test harness agent to auto-run test suites.
- [ ] Deploy reflection-based skill quality scorer.

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

1. **Declarative Over Imperative**: Describe intent in blueprints; let agents decide the how.
2. **Memory is Core**: Learn from every execution and decision trace.
3. **Self-Improving**: Use feedback loops to autonomously evolve capabilities.
4. **Composable by Design**: Everything should be modular, replaceable, observable.
