# Security Requirements for Forgeborn

This document outlines the comprehensive security requirements for the Forgeborn platform, detailing core principles, technical enforcement strategies, agent-level policies, data handling, and future roadmap guidance.

---

## 1. Core Principles

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Enforce authentication and authorization at every layer.
- **Least Privilege**: Agents, users, and systems should only have the permissions necessary for their functions.
- **Defense in Depth**: Apply layered security controls across system boundaries.
- **Auditability**: Ensure traceability and accountability for all actions performed by agents and users.

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **User Authentication**:
  - Support Supabase-based authentication (JWT-based).
  - Optional future support for OIDC providers and SSO integration.

- **Agent Authentication**:
  - Each agent process must carry a signed identity token and role identifier.
  - Identity must be verified before executing any networked or file-based task.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Define role policies for Developer, Architect, Orchestrator, Observer, and Admin personas.
  - Enforce agent-level permissions aligned with their purpose.

---

## 3. Agent Isolation & Execution Boundaries

- **Runtime Isolation**:
  - Each agent should operate in a sandboxed subprocess (e.g., Node.js child process or container).
  - Enforce I/O access restrictions at the file system and network levels.

- **Skill Execution**:
  - Dynamically loaded `.mjs` skills must be verified against a `skills_allowlist.yaml`.
  - Skills must declare:
    - Required inputs
    - Permissions needed
    - Expected outputs

- **Memory Governance**:
  - Memory writing and retrieval is gated through the `memory_steward` agent.
  - All interactions logged with trace ID.

---

## 4. Data Security

- **Secure Logging**:
  - All logs written to `forgeborn.llm_logs` must include:
    - Agent ID
    - Timestamp
    - Task Context
    - Execution Outcome

- **Encryption**:
  - Environment variables and secrets stored in `.env` must be moved to Supabase-managed secrets.
  - In transit: TLS 1.3 or higher for all API communications.
  - At rest: Supabase native encryption used for data storage.

- **Token Handling**:
  - GitHub and Supabase tokens must never be stored in plaintext or committed to the repository.
  - Tokens are accessed through a `secrets_agent` runtime interface.

---

## 5. CI/CD and GitHub Integration

- **GitHub Integration**:
  - PR-triggered GitHub Actions must validate linting, security scan, and agent behavior compliance.
  - Write access to `main` must be gated behind human approval and compliance check.

- **Code Injection Prevention**:
  - Agents generating code must only use approved blueprint structures.
  - All generated files must be validated by the `validator_agent` before commits are issued.

---

## 6. Monitoring, Tracing & Incident Response

- **Execution Trace Memory**:
  - Every agent execution writes a trace record with RC ID, skill run info, and result.

- **Alerts & Anomalies**:
  - Log analysis tool will flag high-risk behaviors:
    - Unauthorized memory access
    - Git push bypass attempts
    - Unexpected shell command usage

- **Incident Response**:
  - Future integration planned with OT security platforms for cross-environment alerting.

---

## 7. Future Roadmap Requirements

- **Supply Chain Verification**:
  - Signature verification for all third-party libraries and skills.
  - GitHub Dependabot and CVE feeds integrated into CI pipeline.

- **Secrets Broker Agent**:
  - Centralize secret retrieval using RBAC from Supabase, Hashicorp Vault, or other.

- **Security Meta Agent**:
  - Continuously evaluate agent behaviors and recommend improvements.
  - Auto-disable skills or agents violating policy.

---

## 8. Appendix: Critical Files for Enforcement

- `.env` → replace with dynamic secrets management
- `skills_allowlist.yaml` → all dynamic skills must match entries
- `trace_logger_skill.mjs` → required for trace compliance
- `meta_orchestrator_v2.ts` → must enforce security policies in planning and execution

This document will evolve as new threats, design patterns, and agent architectures emerge.
