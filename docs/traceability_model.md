# Traceability Model for Forgeborn

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define how traceability is maintained across the Forgeborn system. This includes traceability from high-level goals to detailed implementation and testing, ensuring alignment with stakeholder needs and support for audit, compliance, and iterative improvement.

---

## 1. Overview

Traceability ensures that all components of the Forgeborn system are verifiable, auditable, and consistent with defined objectives. This includes linking:

- Requirements ↔ Features
- Features ↔ Blueprints
- Blueprints ↔ Skills/Agents
- Skills/Agents ↔ Codebase
- Codebase ↔ Tests
- Execution Logs ↔ Source Artifacts

---

## 2. Traceability Matrix

| Source Element           | Target Element(s)                  | Tooling Used                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Vision Document          | Requirements Specification         | Manual, GitHub Issues       |
| Requirements             | Feature Specifications             | `requirements.md`, `features.md` |
| Features                 | Blueprints                         | `blueprints/`, YAML linking |
| Blueprints               | Skills, Agents                     | `skills/`, `agents/`        |
| Skills/Agents            | Code Files, Modules                | `run_*.mjs`, GitHub repo    |
| Skills/Agents            | Tests                              | `tests/`, Jest/Node         |
| RC Execution Logs        | Agent Runs, Blueprint IDs          | `memory/`, `logs/`, Supabase |
| Reflections              | Blueprint Updates, Trace Log IDs   | Supabase trace logs         |

---

## 3. RC Execution Mapping

Each `RC ID` (Release Candidate ID) maps the following:

- The planning blueprint used
- The agents executed (and their versions)
- Logs from execution (in YAML/JSON)
- Reflections recorded
- Final score and evaluation notes

> This allows auditing what influenced a decision, what was executed, and how it evolved.

---

## 4. Supabase Log Mapping

Supabase is used as the central telemetry and audit system:

- `blueprints` → RC ID + content
- `agent_runs` → which agent, when, and how long
- `logs` → LLM calls and actions taken
- `reflections` → generated by evaluator/strategy agents
- `llm_logs` → detailed model/task/response trace

---

## 5. Developer Usage

When developing a new feature:

1. Start with an RC blueprint (define `rc_id`)
2. Ensure it links to documented features
3. The blueprint must invoke traceable agents
4. All skills should reference the RC via logs
5. All outputs are captured via memory + Supabase
6. Reflections prompt blueprint evolution (self-healing)

---

## 6. Tools and References

- GitHub Issues for requirements/features
- Supabase schema for logs
- `rc_trace_log.yaml` files in `memory/`
- `reflections.yaml` for decision history
- `blueprint_summary.yaml` for blueprint → agent linkage

---

## 7. Future Enhancements

- Implement automated graph trace visualizer
- Integrate CLI command `trace --rc RC10` to generate lineage tree
- Expand agent-level trace metadata

---

## 8. Conclusion

Traceability in Forgeborn ensures the integrity of the entire lifecycle—from goals to execution. It supports reproducibility, auditability, and future ML training feedback loops.
