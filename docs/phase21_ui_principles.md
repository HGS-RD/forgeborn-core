# Forgeborn UI Principles

1. **Clarity Over Complexity**
   - Clean layout, no overload

2. **Traceable Transparency**
   - Everything rendered must map to memory, blueprint, or governance logs

3. **Agent-Centric Thinking**
   - Agents are first-class citizens: view, compare, evolve

4. **Live Trust Feedback**
   - Show if system is in a 'healthy' state

5. **Evolving With Autonomy**
   - UI should reflect the current cognitive state of Forgeborn
