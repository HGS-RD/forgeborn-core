# Forgeborn Core (Internal - Hillstrong)

**Forgeborn** is Hillstrong’s internal AI-native software factory. It enables recursive agent-based software development that plans, executes, evaluates, and evolves intelligent code systems automatically.

## 🧠 Capabilities
- Accepts business goals through CLI
- Autonomously generates blueprints
- Executes planning, evaluation, memory, documentation, and governance
- All interactions are logged, scored, and stored in memory
- Designed for secure, private deployments across Hillstrong projects

## 🛡️ Security & Scope
This repository is **private and proprietary**. All code, agents, and logic are for internal Hillstrong development use only. Do not distribute externally.

## 🔁 Internal Usage Example
```bash
factory new "Build a system to automate site-level risk scoring"
cd agent_execution_engine_v2
npm start
```

## 📁 Structure
Refer to `docs/factory_overview.md` for self-generated system architecture and agent roles.
